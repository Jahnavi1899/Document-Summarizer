Two
years
after
her
move
to
San
Francisco,
14-year-old
Riley
Andersen
is
entering
high
school.
Her
personified
emotions
—
Joy,
Sadness,
Fear ,
Disgust,
and
Anger
—
now
oversee
a
newly
formed
element
of
Riley's
mind
called
her
"Sense
of
Self",
which
houses
memories
and
feelings
that
shape
Riley's
beliefs.
Joy,
aiming
to
fill
the
Sense
of
Self
with
only
positive
memories,
has
created
a
mechanism
that
launches
negative
memories
to
the
back
of
Riley's
mind.
Riley
and
her
best
friends,
Bree
and
Grace,
are
invited
to
a
weekend
ice
hockey
camp
where
Riley
hopes
to
qualify
for
her
school's
team,
the
Firehawks.
However ,
a
"Puberty
Alarm"
goes
off
the
night
before
camp,
and
a
group
of
mind
workers
clumsily
upgrade
the
emotion
console,
leaving
Headquarters
in
disarray .
The
emotions
find
that
Riley
now
overreacts
to
any
inputs
they
make
to
the
console.
Four
new
emotions
—
Anxiety ,
Envy ,
Embarrassment,
and
Ennui
—
arrive
and
clash
with
the
original
emotions
over
their
approaches.
In
particular ,
Joy
wants
Riley
to
have
fun
at
camp,
while
Anxiety
focuses
on
winning
a
spot
on
the
team
and
making
new
friends,
especially
after
Riley
learns
that
Bree
and
Grace
will
be
attending
a
different
high
school.
While
Joy
is
in
control,
Riley
inadvertently
gets
the
campers
punished
by
the
strict
camp
director ,
Coach
Roberts.
Anxiety ,
deciding
that
Riley
needs
to
change
to
fit
in
with
the
older
players,
launches
the
Sense
of
Self
to
the
back
of
Riley's
mind
and
has
Joy,
Sadness,
Fear ,
Anger ,
and
Disgust
captured
and
thrown
into
a
memory
vault.
Anxiety ,
Envy ,
Ennui,
and
Embarrassment
then
create
a
new
anxiety-dominated
Sense
of
Self
and
encourage
Riley
to
befriend
popular
hockey
player
Val
Ortiz,
straining
her
friendship
with
Bree
and
Grace.
Joy,
Sadness,
Fear ,
Anger ,
and
Disgust
escape
the
vault;
Sadness
returns
to
Headquarters
while
the
others
go
to
retrieve
Riley's
old
Sense
of
Self.
Under
Anxiety's
control,
Riley
sneaks
into
Coach
Roberts'
office
and
learns
from
her
notebook
that
Riley
is
not
considered
ready
to
become
a
Firehawk.
The
old
emotions
find
the
old
Sense
of
Self
on
a
mountain
of
negative
memories
deposited
by
Joy's
mechanism.
They
cause
an
avalanche
to
return
them
to
Headquarters,
but
this
causes
the
negative
memories
to
spill
into
Riley's
current
Sense
of
Self.
Anxiety
realizes
that
the
Sense
of
Self
she
has
created
for
Riley
is
one
of
self-doubt,
which
causes
Riley
to
perform
poorly
during
her
final
tryout
match,
accidentally
hurt
Grace,
and
get
sent
to
the
penalty
box.
Horrified,
Anxiety
frantically
swarms
the
console
in
a
blinding
whirlwind,
causing
Riley
to
suffer
from
a
severe
panic
attack
.
With
the
help
of
Sadness
and
a
reformed
Embarrassment,
the
other
original
emotions
return
to
Headquarters.
Joy
finds
Anxiety
still
in
control
but
in
paralysis;
Joy
convinces
her
that
Riley
does
not
need
to
change
to
have
a
better
future.
Anxiety
relents
and
Joy
reinstates
Riley's
original
Sense
of
Self,
but
the
panic
attack
persists.
After
the
repentant
Anxiety
admits
that
she
cannot
determine
who
Riley
is,
Joy
realizes
that
the
same
applies
to
her.
Joy
removes
the
first
Sense
of
Self
and
allows
a
new
one
to
form
from
Riley's
positive
and
negative
memories.
The
emotions
embrace
this
third
Sense
of
Self,
calming
Riley
and
helping
her
reconcile
with
Bree
and
Grace.
The
console
calls
for
Joy,
who
takes
command
and
helps
Riley
happily
finish
the
hockey
tryouts.
Riley
befriends
Val
and
the
other
Firehawks
at
high
school
while
staying
true
to
herself
and
maintaining
her
friendship
with
Bree
and
Grace.
Living
in
peace,
the
original
and
new
emotions
worktogether
to
protect
Riley ,
who
checks
her
phone
for
the
Firehawks'
recruitment
results
[c]
and
looks
at
herself
in
the
mirror
with
a
proud
smile.
In
a
post-credits
scene
,
Joy
frees
Riley's
Deep
Dark
Secret,
which
is
revealed
to
be
Riley
burning
a
hole
in
the
rug,
from
The
Vault,
but
he
quickly
shuts
himself
back
in.
